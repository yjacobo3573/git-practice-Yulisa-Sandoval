### 🌈 Summary Of What I Learned
I feel like I learned alot from this experience because I really got the chance to experiment with
most of the collaborative and individual feautures GitHub offers. I've never created multiple branches in a
GitHub repository, so that was a good learning opportunity. Moreover, I've used GitHub alot in the past,
however, I never really gave it the neccessary attention, so this tutorial was a great refresher.

### 🌈 Description Of Collaboration Experience
My collaborative experience worked out well; there were not any problems. Additionally,
my team member gave me some feedback on making my README more decorative, and that really 
helped me out since I don't have much experience in that matter. Furthermore, they sent me
a pull request and I was easily able to merge the changes into my repository.
